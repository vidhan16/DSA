Q1. How is JAVA platform independent language
--> In C/C++ Language the code when compiled gets directly converted to machine code which is architecture specific.
But in JAVA, a layer of abstraction is added i.e. Byte Code and Byte Code is same for every machine whether it is a MACOSX, Windows, Linux..
Then this Byte code is further converted to machine specific code with the help of JVM(JAVA Virtual Machine).This byte code file is sharable to any system.


Q2. What is JVM?
--> JAVA Virtual Machine, works as an interpreter that converts byte code to machine understandable code.
Also responsible for memory management. It engages garbage collector i.e if a part of memory is occupied for a long time and is not in useful further, it automatically cleans it up.
But this has its downside too, it reduces programming speed as GC (Garbage Collector) occupies resources while cleanup.

Q3. What is JRE?
--> JAVA Runtime Environment. All required files and libraries are stored inside JRE.

Q4. What is JDK?
--> JDK is a bundle that comprises of JRE.
Basically,
**
JDK = JRE + Development Tools,
JRE = JVM + Library
JVM = Byte Code, Interpreter
